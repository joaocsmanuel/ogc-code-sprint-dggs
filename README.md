A tutorial for DGGS data integration.

Project Jupyterâ€™s tools are available for installation via the Python Package Index, the leading repository of software created for the Python programming language.

This page uses instructions with pip, the recommended installation tool for Python. If you require environment management as opposed to just installation, look into conda, mamba, pipenv, and Homebrew.

Install JupyterLab with pip:

`pip install jupyterlab`

Note: If you install JupyterLab with conda or mamba, we recommend using the conda-forge channel.

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

`jupyter lab`

Then click on `ogc-code-sprint-data-integration.ipynb`
